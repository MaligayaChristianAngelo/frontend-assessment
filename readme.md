 Explain why the result of `('b' + 'a' + + 'a' + 'a').toLowerCase()` is `banana`.
  
 Answer:When converting values which cannot be converted to number, the result will be NaN. Which means + + turns to NaN
        then it will become lower case because of .toLowerCase(). NaN + ('b' + 'a' + + 'a' + 'a') when combine together will
		    become "banana".
